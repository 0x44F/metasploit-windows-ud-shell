# Windows undetected shell

This shell is undetected to MalwareBytes and Windows Defender, use it wisely.

### Use cases

You would use this when gaining access to a target machine, keep note that this
may not be FUD by the time you get it as AV vendors like to crack down on stuff like this.

### How does it work?

Basically, if you had a look at my other windows defender bypass (on my github) you will
get the gist of how the exploit works.
